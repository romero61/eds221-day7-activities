-   Read in the data sets and store the data frames as `bird_observations`, `sites`, `surveys`, and `taxalist` (it should be clear from the raw file names which is which)

-   

    ```{r}

    bird_observations <-
      read_csv(here::here("data", "knb-lter-cap.256.10", "52_pp52_birds_1.csv"))

    sites <- 
      read_csv(here::here("data", "knb-lter-cap.256.10", "52_pp52_sites_1.csv"))

    surveys <- 
      read_csv(here::here("data", "knb-lter-cap.256.10", "52_pp52_surveys_1.csv"))

    taxalist <- 
      read_csv(here::here("data", "knb-lter-cap.256.10", "52_pp52_taxalist_1.csv"))
    ```

```{=html}

```
-   Create a subset of `bird_observations` called `birds_subset` that only contains observations for birds with species id \"BHCO\" and \"RWBL\", and from sites with site ID \"LI-W\" and \"NU-C\"
